## Project Title 
Reading Room (backend)

## Introduction
An individual effort of creating a perfect spot for readers to assuage their desire for knowledge and entertainment that delivers purpose and enthusiasm. Not only does it allow users to 'read' published books from authors around the world, it also gives budding, local authors a chance to publicize their work with the help of the 'write' feature.

For displaying books, Google Books API is hit. Axios is used for fetching data from the API using get request. When a user writes a story, it is written in MongoDB using mongoose library and published in real-time for other users to read. Registering and logging a user is done with the help of context API at frontend. For security of passwords, bcrypt and salting has been used.
